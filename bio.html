        <p>My name is Elinore Trompeter and I am a third year Arts student at McGill. I major in Sociology and double minor in Social Entrepreneurship and Music Tech. I spend most of my free time listening to music, singing, playing CoD, making food, or hanging out with friends. It would be impossible for me to pick a favorite genre of music, but my top 3 would have to be RnB, Pop Rap, and Gospel!</p>
